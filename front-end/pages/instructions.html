    <h1 class="page_title">TOBEDEFINED - FANTASY BASKETBALL LEAGUE MANAGER</h1>
    <h1 class="page_sub_title">INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Fantasy basketball works on the same basic principles as any other fantasy sport: the game is based on
        constructing teams of players from the respective league and earning points based on their real-life
        performances.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Real life stats are worth a amount of fantasy points(FP). Points are worth 1 fantasy point, assists and
        rebounds are worth 2 fantasy points, and blocks and steals are worth 2.5 fantasy points.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Draft your team, insert your players, and as time goes on insert their games. You can check on the leaderboard
        who has the most points out of all users.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Each team can have up to 12 players, however you may only add 656 games per season, out of a total possible of
        984.
        This is done so you're not screwd by real life injuries. You can also avoid inserting bad games in favor of
        better ones to some degree.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Good luck and have fun!
    </p>
